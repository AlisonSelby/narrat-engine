# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

At the moment there is no "LTS" version. To get updates simply stay on the latest version of narrat.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 2.x     | :white_check_mark: |
| < 2.x   | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

You can report a vulnerability either in issues, on discord, or by email.

Please note that the security warnings given during `npm install` tend to be irrelevant because they relate to user-injection exploits in build tools, which are not an issue because build tools are not being run with any third party user data.
