# Welcome to Narrat contributing guide.

Thank you for investing your time in contributing to narrat. Please read our [Code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) before you start.

This guide contains an overview of how this repo works and how to get started making changes to it.

## Introduction

Narrat is a game engine for making interactive narrative RPGs packed with features like fully fledged scripting language with branching choices, skills system, inventory, quests and more.

To know more about how narrat is used, go to [docs.narrat.dev](https://docs.narrat.dev/).

## How to contribute

See the [Development section of the readme](./README.md#development-for-contributors) for info on how to get started running the code, and a primer on the engine's architecture and components.

It could be useful to mention what you're about to work on, just in case anyone else might be working on the same thing, or to get advice on the best approach. To that end, an issue can be opened, or it can be discussed on Discord.

There is a [Discord server](https://discord.gg/Xgz7EQ2Xgh) available for discussion and help.

## Opening PRs

All that's required for opening a PR at the moment is to make a useful improvement or bugfix to the engine, and make sure the code passes CI tests.

Once reviewed, the PR will be merged and can be included in future versions

## When contributions are released

For the moment, releases are done manually. The changelog is also written manually. Contributions that get merged into main should be included in the next release (which tend to be frequent as the engine is sitll in fast-paced early development)
